# EvolutionSim
A basic evolution simulator that uses Webpack and Kontra.js.

Each sprite is a square with various properties that it then uses to breed, if they are successful enough, or die, if they aren't.

It has a simple UI which allows users to pause, restart and view the props of the sprites/squares.

Run npm run build to compress /src into /dist.
